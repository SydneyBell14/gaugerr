The goal of the gaugerr package is to use common models to implement gauge R&R analysis in the tidymodels framework. This package also provides a unified and familiar interface for analysts.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gaugerr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aloy/gaugerr")
```

## Example

This is an example which shows you how to use the gauge_rr function that runs the general analysis:

```{r, include=FALSE}
data1 <- data.frame(P=c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,
                          4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,
                          7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,
                          10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10),
                      Y=c(37,38,37,41,41,40,41,42,41,42,41,43,42,42,42,43,42,43,
                          30,31,31,31,31,31,29,30,28,42,43,42,43,43,43,42,42,42,
                          28,30,29,29,30,29,31,29,29,42,42,43,45,45,45,44,46,45,
                          25,26,27,28,28,30,29,27,27,40,40,40,43,42,42,43,43,41,
                          25,25,25,27,29,28,26,26,26,35,34,34,35,35,34,35,34,35),
                      O=c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,
                          1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,
                          1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,                      1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3))
```

```{r example}
library(gaugerr)
gauge_rr(data1, P, O, Y, interaction=FALSE)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
